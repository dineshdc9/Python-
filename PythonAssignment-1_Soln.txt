## Assignment Part-1
Q1. Why do we call Python as a general purpose and high-level programming language?
Ans.Because Python codes are not written in machine-readable(binary)language which makes it human readable, 
    so Python programs need to be processed before machines can run them. 
    Python is an interpreted language means that every time a program is run,
    its interpreter runs through the code and translates it into machine-readable byte code


Q2. Why is Python called a dynamically typed language?
Ans.As We need not specify the type of variable while creating as 
    the interpreter assigns variables a type at runtime based on the variable's value at the time if not specified.


Q3. List some pros and cons of Python programming language?
	Pros					Cons
Beginner-friendly			Issues with design
Large Community				Slower than compiled languages
Flexible and Extensible			Security
Extensive Libraries			Work Environment
Embeddable				High memory consumption
Highly Scalable				Dynamically-typed language
IoT Opportunities			Complex multithreading
Portable				Garbage collection leads to potential memory losses


Q4. In what all domains can we use Python?
Ans.Web development,AI and Data Science,OS development,Scientific programming,Gaming,,Cyber and Network Security etc.


Q5. What are variable and how can we declare them?
Ans.Variables are containers for storing data values.Python does not have a specific command for declaring a variable, it can be
    created the moment you first assign a value to it.


Q6. How can we take an input from the user in Python?
Ans.We use the input() method.Python stops executing when it comes to the input() function, 
    and continues when the user has given some input.
eg.	username = input("Enter username:")
   	print("Username is: " + username)


Q7. What is the default datatype of the value that has been taken as an input using input() function?
Ans.  a string


Q8. What is type casting?
Ans.The conversion of one data type into the other data type is known as type casting in python
eg. 	string into integer
	number = int("value")


Q9. Can we take more than one input from the user using single input() function? If yes, how? If no, why?
Ans. Yes it can be done using Using split() method, it is useful for getting multiple inputs from users at a time
     syntax:input().split(separator, maxsplit)
eg.	# taking two inputs at a time
	x, y = input("Enter two values: ").split()
	print("Number of boys: ", x)
	print("Number of girls: ", y)
	print()


Q10. What are keywords?
Ans.Python keywords are unique words reserved with defined meanings and functions that we can only apply for those functions. 
    we'll never need to import any keyword into the program because they're permanently present.
    eg.and,is,for,if,not,or,else etc.


Q11. Can we use keywords as a variable? Support your answer with reason.
Ans. No we cannot use keywords as variable names. It's because keywords have predefined meanings and there will be confusion.


Q12. What is indentation? What's the use of indentaion in Python?
Ans. Indentation refers to the spaces at the beginning of a code line. Where in other programming languages the indentation in 
     code is for readability only, the indentation in Python is very important. Python uses indentation to indicate a block of code.


Q13. How can we throw some output in Python?
Ans. Using print function


Q14. What are operators in Python?
Ans. In Python, operators are special symbols that designate that some sort of computation should be performed. 
     The values that an operator acts on are called operands.
     eg.>>> a = 10
	>>> b = 20
	>>> a + b
	30
	In this case, the + operator adds the operands a and b together
Types:Arithmetic,Comparison,Assignment,Logical etc.


Q15. What is difference between / and // operators?
Ans. / corresponds to division eg. 5/2 =2.5 whereas
    // corresponds to floor division eg. 5//2=2


Q16. Write a code that gives following as an output.
```
iNeuroniNeuroniNeuroniNeuron
```
Ans.	a="iNeuroniNeuroniNeuroniNeuron"
	print(a)


Q17. Write a code to take a number as an input from the user and check if the number is odd or even.
Ans.num = int(input("Enter a number: "))  
    if (num % 2) == 0:  
       print("{0} is Even number".format(num))  
   else:  
       print("{0} is Odd number".format(num)) 


Q18. What are boolean operator?
Ans. The logical operators and, or and not are also referred to as boolean operators. 
     While and as well as or operator needs two operands, which may evaluate to true or false, 
     not operator needs one operand evaluating to true or false.
Boolean and operator returns true if both operands return true.
Boolean or operator returns true if any one operand is true
The not operator returns true if its operand is a false expression and returns false if it is true.


Q19. What will the output of the following?
```
1 or 0

0 and 0

True and False and True

1 or 0 or 0
```
Ans.True
    True
    False
    True


Q20. 
Ans.A conditional statement is used to handle conditions in python program. 
These statements guide the program while making decisions based on the conditions encountered by the program.
Python has 3 key Conditional Statements that you should know:
if statement
if-else statement
if-elif-else ladder


Q21. What is use of 'if', 'elif' and 'else' keywords?
Ans.if statement is used to determine whether a block of code will be executed or not. Meaning if the program finds the 
    condition defined in the if statement to be true, it will go ahead and execute the code block inside the if statement
The else statement works in conjuncture with the if statement to execute a code block when the defined if condition is false.
The elif statement is used to check for multiple conditions and execute the code block within if any of the conditions evaluate to be true.
the elif statement is similar to the else statement in the context that it is optional but unlike the else statement, 
there can be multiple elif statements in a code block following an if statement.


Q22. Write a code to take the age of person as an input and if age >= 18 display "I can vote". If age is < 18 display "I can't vote".
Ans.
      age = int(input('Enter your age in years: '))
      if age >= 18:
         print("I can vote")
      else:
         print("I can't vote")



Q23. Write a code that displays the sum of all the even numbers from the given list.
```
numbers = [12, 75, 150, 180, 145, 525, 50]
```
Ans. myList = [12, 75, 150, 180, 145, 525, 50]
     sum(num for num in myList if not num%2)


Q24. Write a code to take 3 numbers as an input from the user and display the greatest no as output.
Ans. 
num1 = float(input("Enter first number: "))
num2 = float(input("Enter second number: "))
num3 = float(input("Enter third number: "))

if (num1 >= num2) and (num1 >= num3):
   largest = num1
elif (num2 >= num1) and (num2 >= num3):
   largest = num2
else:
   largest = num3

print("The largest number is", largest)



Q25. Write a program to display only those numbers from a list that satisfy the following conditions

- The number must be divisible by five

- If the number is greater than 150, then skip it and move to the next number

- If the number is greater than 500, then stop the loop
```
numbers = [12, 75, 150, 180, 145, 525, 50]
```
Ans.
a = [12, 75, 150, 180, 145, 525, 50]
b = []
for i in a:
    if i > 150:
        if i > 500:
            break
        continue
    if i % 5 == 0:
        b.append(i)
        
print(b)
